# install-pentest-arch
Create an installation medium for my personal pentesting Arch Linux. I don't know if this is useful for someone else, but here you go.

# Create Arch ISO
Only works on Arch btw!

    sudo pacman -S --needed git archiso
    sudo ./create_arch_iso.sh

The installer will generate a current arch iso at ./archiso/out/

This .iso file when booted into will automatically install an Arch Linux system with cinnamon desktop and the BlackArch repo added after you input the desired installation device. You may install tools as needed after first boot. Please refer to the official [BlackArch Wiki](https://blackarch.wiki/) for that.

# Why
I just wanted a clean Arch Linux with Cinnamon and the BlackArch repo added for easy installation in VMs.
