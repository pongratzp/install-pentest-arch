# install-pentest-arch
Create an installation medium for my personal pentesting Arch Linux. I don't know if this is useful for someone else, but here you go.

# Create Arch ISO
Only works on Arch btw!

    sudo pacman -S --needed git archiso
    sudo ./create_arch_iso.sh

The installer will generate a current arch iso at ./archiso/out/

This .iso file when booted into will automatically install an Arch Linux system with cinnamon desktop and the BlackArch repo added. Additionally, all BlackArch tools will be installed. Please change this to your needs!
